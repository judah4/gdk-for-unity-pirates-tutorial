# Pirates 1 — Set up the game

Welcome to the Pirates Tutorial!

In this lesson you'll:

* **set up your machine** for development with SpatialOS
* **run the Pirates game** locally
* **use the Inspector** to explore the game world
* **learn about entities, components and workers** - the core concepts of SpatialOS

This first lesson is mostly background work you need to do before you can get going with development. Once your machine is
set up and the game is running, we’ll use the game to explain the basic concepts of SpatialOS. So bear with us!

## 1. Set up your machine

To set up your machine for developing with SpatialOS, follow the setup guide:

* [Unity GDK Setup](https://docs.improbable.io/unity/alpha/machine-setup)

## 2. Set up the PiratesTutorial project

In this tutorial, download the GDK Pirates Tutorial.


## 3. Open the Tutorial in your Unity Editor

## 4. Start the Local Server

In your Unity Editor, launch a local deployment of your game by selecting SpatialOS > Local launch

## 5. Launch The Development Scene

Sail around! WASD to move. Q and E to fire the cannons.

### What's next?

In the [next lesson](../../tutorials/pirates/lesson2.md) you'll add some new entities to the world:
enemy pirate ships.
