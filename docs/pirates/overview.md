# Pirates tutorial: overview

> **Learn the principles of working with SpatialOS by adding simple features to a Unity multiplayer game.**

This tutorial, based on a pirate ship game, will teach you how to develop a game using SpatialOS and
[Unity](https://unity3d.com/).

### What you'll learn

Through adding features to the game, you'll learn about:

* how to **design game features** in a way that takes advantage of SpatialOS
* **features of SpatialOS** and its SpatialOS SDK for Unity
* **command-line and deployment tools** that come with SpatialOS
* the **local development workflow**
* how to **deploy the game locally** so you can test it, and **to the cloud** so you can play in multiplayer

We've created the bare bones of a game for you to build on. It's a simple world where
players have pirate ships that can move about through the world, exploring the seas and navigating
between islands.

### Game features

As you go through the tutorial, you'll add the following gameplay features:

* **spawning enemy pirate ships** that move around the world
* giving ships **the ability to fire cannons** that damage other ships
* giving ships **the property of 'health'**
* **playing a sinking animation** when a ship's health falls to zero

You'll finish this tutorial with both a conceptual and practical understanding of how to use SpatialOS to build your
own game.
